        <p>Climate change is one of the biggest ongoing problems in the world in this century. On top of that, the United States is one of the top contributors to greenhouse gas emissions at 11%, while China takes the top spot with 27%. The U.S. number is high due to how much consumption occurs from citizens, along with energy usage being a big factor. To add on, with supply chains being more common within the U.S., a lot of factories and farms/indoor farming facilities use a lot of products that are overlooked because of the high consumption and demand rates of consumers. However, information isn’t heavily publicized about what exactly causes more greenhouse gas emissions and what doesn’t. </p>

        <p>Greenhouse gas emissions are a mix of gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, that are released into the atmosphere and trap heat inside, which creates a type of “greenhouse effect” that has been warming the planet. The use of these chemicals is more common than people realize, said Ronald F. Mencl, who is the current superintendent at Warwick Valley Golf Course in Warwick, New York. He said that, along with fertilizers that they use to keep the greens on the course looking sharp (which have nitrogen and phosphorus in them), the maintenance crew uses a mix of herbicides, fungicides, insect killers, and plant growth chemicals that manage the amount of grass that grows on the greens and other parts of the turf. The maintenance crew also uses different types of machinery to distribute the chemicals onto the course, all of them requiring fuel and/or gas to operate, which also increases the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Mencl also took the time to specify that it isn’t just golf courses that use these types of chemicals for gain: farms all across America use the same chemicals in large amounts to protect crops that are grown for supermarket sales. “Considering how many farms exist in and around the States, like in Canada or Mexico, there’s no doubt that the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that are in are atmosphere alone is astronomical,” Mencl said. </p>

        <p>Out of 1,016 common causes for gas emissions that this data lists, these are the top 9 contributors.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>According to data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, there are 1,016 (or more) causes of greenhouse gas emissions in the country alone. The largest cause of greenhouse gas emissions within the United States is cement manufacturing. The process of making cement is very energy-intensive, as it includes extracting raw materials by using specific machinery, preheating the materials, cooling, and then packaging the final products. The rest of the causes are related to farming, as mencl specified. However, it is not just the chemicals used to grow crops that are contributing to gas emissions in the atmosphere, but also livestock maintenance and dairy product production. A lot of the rituals used in doing either of these things include machines and/or labor that uses chemicals or high levels of energy to distribute materials for the processes. For example, with cattle feedlots at 2.85% for the cause of greenhouse gas emissions, facilities are using energy to raise cows on a faster schedule to meet consumer demand for USDA-grade meat. With how many customers the meat industry has, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions being added into the atmosphere is happening at a rapid rate. </p>

        <p>These are the top 6 greenhouse gas emissions causes that include margins. All causes include some type of relation to farming.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>The major causes of greenhouse gas emissions change, however, when margins are included. Marginal guidelines of greenhouse gas emissions numbers isolate emissions from their last generators needed, which is done to meet changes in demand. This shows the actual impact of what using more or less energy looks like in manufacturing, which is important for fast consumption and renewable materials.

With the impact of using more energy, farming production takes over the top cause for greenhouse gas emissions, with a total of 13.65% of emissions factors spread out across six different categories. 

So, what does this mean for the future of supply chains and manufacturing? Unfortunately, there will be no drastic decrease in their operations that use chemicals and energy in their production, as demand from consumers has only increased since 2017. As the country’s population becomes more dense, companies have to appeal to the consumption numbers, as it is the way they make the most money. While the processes that they use could be restructured and function differently to protect the planet more effectively, the efficiency and money-grab factors are the most important part as to why they have not changed their production types. Even if the chances of change in farm and material production are slim, the high numbers of greenhouse gas emissions from supply chains, as well as the increasing climate levels, are making civilians more aware of what is going into our planet’s atmosphere and can help them understand what exactly is going wrong within manufacturing systems to cause it. With more knowledge comes more solutions to how the world can handle climate change
